## Jupyter Notebooks for Sat-Chirp Project
A project to research and implement a system where almost instantaneous frequency translation and mode (USB or LSB) can be 
determined for a linear amateur satellite by sending a short (< 1s) digitally-coded message on the uplink and doing DSP on 
the whole downlink band.
